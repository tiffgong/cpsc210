# My Personal Project

## Pew pew game


- **What will the application do?**  
It will be an arcade type  game where the player 
can go around and shoot targets and also die. The main goal is to just get as high
of a score as possible. Collecting stars or "reloads" grants 5 points and killing
targets grant 1 each. Bullets are limited but can picked up under the guise of stars.
- **Who will use it?**
  <br> Anyone who wants to play a game.
- **Why is this project of interest to you?**
  <br>This project is of interest to me as I play lots of video games
in my free time. In previous classes in high school, I also had opportunities
for independent project, where I also created games, mainly 2d ones. 
Additionally, I hope to maybe go into game development
in the future.
